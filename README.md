cvutil - Convenient algorithms for OpenCV
=========================================

An Introduction to cvutil
-------------------------
cvutil is the swiss army knife for coding some computer vision algorithms.
cvutil organizes some general concepts. By using cvutil, you can easily parallelize your algorithms and write it as an intelligible.

What you need to use cvutil
---------------------------
cvutil is the header-only library. In order to use cvutil, all you have to do is copy it into your include directory.

I tested it on OpenCV version 2.3. 2.x might work well but are not tested.
